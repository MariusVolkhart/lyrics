  "lyrics": "Riding on the city of New Orleans\nIllinois Central, Monday morning rail\nFifteen cars and fifteen restless riders\nThree conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail\n\nAll along the southbound odyssey\nThe train pulled out at Kankakee\nAnd rolls along past houses, farms and fields\nPassin\' trains that have no names\nAnd freight yards full of old black men\nAnd the graveyards of the rusted automobiles\n\nGood morning, America\nHow are you?\nSay don\'t you know me? I\'m your native son\nI\'m the train they call the city of New Orleans\nAnd I\'ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nDealin\' card games with the old men in the club car\nPenny a point ain\'t no one keepin\' score\nPass the paper bag that holds the bottle\nFeel the wheels rumblin\' \'neath the floor\n\nAnd the sons of Pullman Porters\nAnd the sons of engineers\nRide their father\'s magic carpet made of steel\nMothers with their babes asleep\nAre rockin\' to the gentle beat\nAnd the rhythm of the rail is all they feel\n\nGood morning, America\nHow are you?\nSay don\'t you know me? I\'m your native son\nI\'m the train they call the city of New Orleans\nI\'ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\n\nNighttime on the city of New Orleans\nChanging cars in Memphis, Tennessee\nHalf way home, we\'ll be there by morning\nThrough the Mississippi darkness\nRolling down to the sea\n\nBut all the towns and people seem\nTo fade into a bad dream\nAnd the steel rails still ain\'t heard the news\nThe conductor sings his songs again\nThe passengers will please refrain\nThis train has got the disappearing railroad blues\n\nGood morning, America\nHow are you?\nSay don\'t you know me? I\'m your native son\nI\'m the train they call the city of New Orleans\nI\'ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\nI\'ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done\nI\'ll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done",
