  "lyrics": "Almost heaven, West Virginia\nBlue Ridge Mountains\nShenandoah River,\nLife is old there\nOlder than the trees\nYounger than the mountains\nBlowin\' like the breeze\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\nWest Virginia, mountain momma\nTake me home, country roads\nAll my memories gathered \'round her\nMiner\'s lady, stranger to blue water\nDark and dusty, painted on the sky\nMisty taste of moonshine\nTeardrops in my eye\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\nWest Virginia, mountain momma\nTake me home, country roads\nI hear her voice\nIn the mornin\' hour she calls me\nThe radio reminds me of my home far away\nAnd drivin\' down the road I get a feelin\'\nThat I should have been home yesterday, yesterday\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\nWest Virginia, mountain momma\nTake me home, country roads\nCountry roads, take me home\nTo the place I belong\nWest Virginia, mountain momma\nTake me home, country roads\nTake me home, now country roads\nTake me home, now country roads",
